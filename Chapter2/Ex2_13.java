    a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%. Thus, the monthly interest 
    rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account becomes
    100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
    After the second month, the value in the account becomes
    (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
    After the third month, the value in the account becomes
    (100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
    and so on.
    Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the account value after the sixth month. (In Programming Exercise 5.30, you 
    will use a loop to simplify the code and display the account value for any month.) */
