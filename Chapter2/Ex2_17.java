    /*How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is 
    not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In 2001, 
    the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature 
    to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed.
    t_(wc) = 35.74 + 0.6215*t_(a) - 35.75*v^0.16 + 0.4275*t_(a)*v^0.16
    where t_(a) is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit, v is the speed 
    measured in miles per hour, and t_(wc) is the wind-chill temperature. The formula cannot 
    be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58°F or above 41°F.
    Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58°F
    and 41°F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 then displays the wind-chill 
    temperature.
